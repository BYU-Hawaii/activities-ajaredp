        <ol>
            <li><p>Katniss Everdeen, a skilled hunter from a poor district, volunteers for the Hunger Games, a televised event where teenagers fight to the death. She does this to save her younger sister, Primrose, who was reaped as tribute.</p></li>
            <li><p>Katniss and Peeta Mellark, the other tribute from their district, travel to the Capitol, the opulent seat of power, for training and preparation. They hone their survival skills and craft a strategy to win the Games.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the arena, Katniss and Peeta form an alliance with Rue, a young tribute from another district. They face dangerous threats from other tributes, environmental hazards, and the Gamemakers who control the arena. Through cunning and defiance, they challenge the rules and expectations of the Games.</p></li>
            <li><p>After Rue's tragic death, the Gamemakers announce a rule change that allows two tributes from the same district to win together. Katniss and Peeta feign a romance to gain favor with sponsors and ensure their survival.</p></li>
            <li><p>Katniss's defiance, particularly her threat of a double suicide with Peeta, sparks a rebellion in the oppressed districts. The Games become a symbol of the Capitol's cruelty and the districts' simmering discontent.</p></li>
            <li><p>Katniss and Peeta, by defying the Capitol and emerging as victors, become symbols of hope and resistance against the tyrannical regime. Their actions ignite a fire of rebellion that will engulf Panem in the coming novels.</p></li>

            <p id="targetParagraph">In what was once North America, the Capitol of Panem maintains its hold on its 12 districts by forcing them each to select a boy and a girl, called Tributes, to compete in a nationally televised event called the Hunger Games. Every citizen must watch as the youths fight to the death until only one remains. District 12 Tribute <b>Katniss Everdeen</b> <i>(Jennifer Lawrence)</i> has little to rely on, other than her hunting skills and sharp instincts, in an arena where she must weigh survival against love.</p>
