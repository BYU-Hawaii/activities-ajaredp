        <h3>Here's What Happened</h3>
        <img src="images/pic.jpg" alt="" class="float-img">
        <p>I was originally called to serve as a full-time teaching missionary. Yet, being a missionary can also be a tough calling. Leaving everything you have, changing your daily routines and habits, adjusting to a new environment, mingling with every person you meet, learning the culture and language, and knowing the fact that you are just on your own and away from your family. During my in-field mission, emotional and physical distresses and challenges have crossed my path—which limits me to serve in the field and be sent home. Every thing seems to be gloomy for me. Lots of questions and doubts. I was clueless. I do not know which path I should take. I called upon the Lord for help and answers on what I should do. “Shall I falter or shall I finish?” This awakening question suddenly came to my heart and mind. My desire of serving a mission continues to ablaze in spite of my limitation and circumstance. In D&C 4:3 it says, “…if ye have desires to serve God, ye are called to the work.” I accepted the call to be reinstated and reassigned as a full-time young service missionary. Nevertheless, as I pursue my service mission, countless criticisms and comparison have arose, which led me to questioning my worth and losing my self-esteem. I began to be ashamed and felt disregarded. I started to feel more likely to be a less missionary and have no progress. There are a legion of words which I don’t like to hear that will kindle my depression. I admit that I have lost my hope of being a service missionary. Inumerable times did I plan to get released already. Sincere and fervent prayers were my ways to ease my pessimistic feeling. I counseled with the Lord and have inquired with one of the leaders of the Church—“why does every one treat us differently? why did the Lord still call me to be a teaching missionary but later on will be a service missionary? why am i service missionary?” After expressing what I felt, that leader began to utter with a loving and gentle tone as if the Lord is speaking with me. The room was quiet, and the Spirit dwelled. He spoke, “Elder Adzuara, don’t you know that the restoration continues to unfold? It wasn’t finish yet during the time of Joseph Smith. But in these latter-days, we will witness an ongoing restoration of the Church and His gospel. You, being one of the pioneers of the service mission, is part of that restoration. As the restoration unfolds, the same as the work of the Lord expands. And you are greatly needed of the Lord in this extended work He has given you. There are things that only service missionaries can do because you were foreordained with that sacred calling you have. You have been set-apart. You are His servant. You are the extension of His hands to reach out to His children. There are things that only you can do because you were foreordained to do it and being a pioneer is a not an easy phase to face just like the early saints of the Church. You are not a secondary or less missionary. Despite your limitations and challenges you have, your capacity to work and perform this sacred labor is limitless. This moment will be soon forever be etched in your heart. And you will be bless throughout eternity because of your desire and willingness to be engaged in the service of the Lord and help others come unto Him through your selfless and charitable service you render. May that be an expression of gratitude and the Lord is grateful for what you can do for Him.” These words helped me to know myself more and what the Lord is trying to say. All fears and doubts were replaced by faith and courage. All “whys” were turned into “whats”. If I continually seek for His grace and help, I can be reminded of my eternal destiny and stay on the covenant path.
As every member who have served missions may say—serving missions can be difficult which often requires sacrifice, but how sweet are the blessings your mission can bring to your life and throughout eternity as you give your all to Him who hath giveth thy life. During my mission experiences, I can say that it’s really hard, more than you have anticipated before you enter the mission; however, knowing the fact that you represent the Savior, you are entitled to call for His help in every way. I am eternally grateful to have the opportunity to serve as a teaching and service missionary. My missionary journey have richly blessed and taught me about my divine potential as His son and an heir of His kingdom if I stayed true to my covenants.</p>
