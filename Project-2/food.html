                <figcaption><em>Figure 1:</em> Adobo is a beloved Filipino stew known for its salty, sour, and sometimes sweet flavor.  It typically features chicken, pork, or seafood braised in a savory sauce made with vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and peppercorns.  Unlike its Latin American cousins, Filipino adobo doesn't usually include chilies, making it a more tangy than spicy dish.  This flavorful dish is a staple in Filipino households and is often served with rice.</figcaption>
